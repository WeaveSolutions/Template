## Zapier Architecture
- **Zap Framework**: Core automation units connecting triggers to actions
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time event processing and data transfer
- **API Connectivity**: REST API integration with external services
- **Cloud Processing**: Serverless execution environment for workflows
- **State Management**: Persistent data storage across workflow steps

## Trigger Systems
- **App Triggers**: Events from connected applications (new emails, forms, etc.)
- **Webhook Triggers**: Custom HTTP endpoints for external integrations
- **Schedule Triggers**: Time-based automation for recurring tasks
- **RSS/Feed Triggers**: Content monitoring and automatic processing
- **Email Parser**: Extract data from email content automatically

## Action Execution
- **App Actions**: Perform operations in connected third-party applications

- **Update Operations**: Modify existing data in target applications
- **Notification Systems**: Send alerts via email, SMS, and messaging apps
- **File Management**: Upload, download, and manipulate files

## Multi-Step Workflows
- **Sequential Processing**: Chain multiple actions in logical order
- **Parallel Branches**: Execute multiple action paths simultaneously
- **Data Passing**: Transfer information between workflow steps
- **Loop Operations**: Iterate through data sets and perform batch operations
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-built automation patterns for common use cases

## Data Transformation
- **Field Mapping**: Map data fields between different applications
- **Data Formatting**: Transform data types, dates, and text formats
- **Custom Functions**: JavaScript code execution for complex transformations
